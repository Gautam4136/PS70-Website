    Taking steps towards my final project, I 3d printed some piano keys using the Prusa i3 in black PLA. The file drawing 
    was from the previous week's assignment. I shrinked the keys to half the size because the initial print time was around 9 hours, and that was not 
    necessary for this first version. I also decided to only make few keys instead of the full octave to simplify things. 
    At first the tolerance space in the drawing was not sufficient, so the smaller keys got stuck every time. I simply, sanded them 
    down with a belt sander to create more allowance which made it work.

      To house the keys and the motor, I drew up a cardboard frame with holes for the piano keys to hinge,
      and also for the spinning barrel. I also designed some tabs that could be glued on to the cardboard tube 
      to hit the keys.
