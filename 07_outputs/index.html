<h3>Week 7: Electronic Outputs</h3>



<h4>Assignment: Minimum Viable Product for Final Project</h4>

The minimum viable product for my automatic music engraver was supposed to be able to display keys pressed
on music staff, and also be able to play notes. I was able to create two keys that play two different notes,
and it shows them on the tft lcd.

<image style = "width: 75%" src = "./MVP_pic.png" alt = "week 8 placeholder"> </image>

There are still issues with the sound and the display. Currently, the arduino is only able to output a single
frequency at a time, but I would like to be able to play chords with multiple frequencies. I will have to 
sum waveforms and create an array to play multiple notes at once.

Additionlly, the screen flickers due to the loop in the code. I will have to restructure it into classes,
and use millis() to keep track of active notes so that I won't have to constantly be resetting the screen
every loop.
