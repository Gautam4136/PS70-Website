<h3>Final Project: Room occupancy indicator</h3>
<br></br>
In my apartment, we have 4 roommates and one bathroom, and I often find myself getting to the bathroom only to find it occupied, and have to 
keep walking back and forth from my room to check if it is unoccupied.
It would be nice to have an app or display in my room so that I can know if the bathroom is occupied or not.
I thought have have a magnetic sensor at the door to detect if it is closed or open, or a light sensor to tell if the light is on.
I would also record this data to track the bathroom usage pattern my apartment to figure out the best
time for me to adjust my wake up time and morning routine.
